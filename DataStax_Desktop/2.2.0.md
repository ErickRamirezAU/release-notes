Release notes for [DataStax Desktop](https://downloads.datastax.com/#desktop).
 
## v2.2.0
*Released 21 July 2020*

## Highlights

The Guided Experience and Example stacks now use Cassandra 4.0 Beta 1.
### Changes and enhancements

* The Guided Experience screen includes paths to DataStax Enterprise (DSE) and DataStax Astra.
* Fixed an issue that prevented users from quitting the application from the Cassandra tutorial and CQL Shell screens.
* Improved metrics tracking to help improve the product experience. When tracking is enabled, added the following metrics:
    * When using a button or link that takes you to an external website, along with the destination URL.
    * When quitting the application or closing a window.
* Fixed an issue that prevented tab changes on the Cassandra tutorial from being tracked.
* For Mac installations, the Guided Experience screen now includes a Start Docker button when Docker is installed but not running.
* For Windows and Linux, closing the main DataStax Desktop window will now close all other Desktop windows and exit the application.

**This is an old version.** An index of all versions is available [here](https://github.com/datastax/release-notes/DataStax_Desktop/DataStax_Desktop.md).
